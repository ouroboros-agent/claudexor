 *   pre-existing semantics, now per lane;
 * - the vendor rate-limit floor (`rateLimitedNotBefore`): armed when a cycle
 *   observes a typed `rate_limited` absence for this vendor, honoring the
 *   vendor's Retry-After when known (max with the exponential ladder, 60s
 *   minimum). Persisted through the daemon-private store so a restart is not
 *   a 429 amplifier, and deliberately NOT reset by a credential change —
 *   logging in again does not un-rate-limit the vendor endpoint.
 *
 * Evidence/demand semantics stay with QuotaRegistry; this class owns only
 * scheduling state. Single-flight of the poll sweep also lives in the
 * registry, which drives every lane from one sweep.
