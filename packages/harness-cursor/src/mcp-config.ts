/**
 * Engine-owned MCP injection for cursor-agent (the delegation belt, and any
 * future engine-owned server). Unlike claude (inline `--mcp-config` JSON) and
 * codex (`-c mcp_servers.*` overrides), cursor-agent has no stateless
 * transport: it reads `mcp.json` from its config dir. Claudexor already owns
 * the per-lane `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` (a Claudexor-created state dir under the
 * lane/profile HOME — INV-063: scoped vendor state stays outside every
 * worktree), so injection writes `<CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR>/mcp.json` there and the
 * run adds `--approve-mcps` so the headless agent does not stall on an
 * approval prompt.
 *
 * The write is a RECONCILE, not a blind overwrite: a sidecar manifest
 * (claudexor-managed-mcp.json) records exactly which server names Claudexor
 * injected, so a later run without `extra_mcp_servers` removes ONLY those
 * entries (a stale belt must never ride a non-delegate run — that would be an
 * undisclosed injection), while entries written by the vendor or a human are
 * structurally preserved (re-serialized through JSON, so formatting/key order
 * normalize; their content is never dropped). Failure honesty: an UNREADABLE
 * mcp.json is never silently deleted — cleanup preserves it with a typed
 * disclosure, injection quarantines the bytes aside before writing fresh; an
 * unreadable manifest falls back to the deterministic engine-owned names so a
 * stale belt cannot ride orphaned; a readable-manifest miss on a same-named
 * foreign entry refuses injection typed instead of adopting-then-deleting it.

 * - unreadable MCP.JSON on cleanup: preserved untouched (bytes are not ours

 *   still ride inside the unreadable file;
 * - unreadable MCP.JSON on injection: the bytes are quarantined aside
 *   (mcp.json.invalid-<ts>), never deleted, then a fresh file is written;
 * - a FOREIGN entry squatting a requested engine name (readable manifest
 *   that does not list it): throws — the caller refuses injection typed
 *   rather than adopting and later destroying someone else's entry.
 * Write order is crash-safe: the manifest (union of old and new names) lands
 * BEFORE mcp.json, so a crash between the two leaves an over-wide manifest
 * (harmless: removing an absent key is a no-op) instead of an untracked belt.
 * Throws on an unwritable dir — the caller surfaces that typed (INV-030:
