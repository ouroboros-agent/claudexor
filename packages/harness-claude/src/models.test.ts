/**
 * Manifest model-truth pinning (INV-104): `known_models` is the strict truth
 * source — an explicit model outside it is refused up front, never forwarded
 * to die as an opaque native error. These tests pin the CURRENT catalog
 * entries end to end: the manifest advertises the id, the stamp names the
 * exact installed CLI the list was verified against, and the truth owner
 * (`validateModel`) accepts the id round-trip. A model added to the vendor
 * catalog but missing here is exactly the PR #54 defect shape: the newest
 * Opus was unpinnable while the bare `opus` alias silently floated.
