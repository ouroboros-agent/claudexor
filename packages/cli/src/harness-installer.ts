/**
 * `claudexor harness install` — the disclosed, pinned vendor installer
 * (issue #89; restored from the PR #82 cut with the security objections
 * fixed). The historical/default `remote` target remains the SSH-host flow;
 * an explicit `local` target installs into the managed toolchain root that
 * local harness resolution already owns.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - npm-distributed harnesses (claude/codex/opencode) install ONE exact
 *   version — the per-package vendor-version SSOT — never `@latest`. npm
 *   verifies the registry integrity checksum for an exact version, so the
 *   pin is a real guarantee. For claude/codex that SSOT is the value the
 *   model/effort freshness gates verified; the opencode pin is a
 *   deterministic install target, NOT a verification claim (no recorded
 *   fixture yet — see packages/harness-opencode vendor-cli-version.ts).
 * - cursor and agy have no npm artifact and CANNOT be pinned. Instead of
 *   pretending, the HUMAN is the verifier: the complete vendor script is
 *   downloaded first (never piped to a shell), its size and sha256 are
 *   printed, and it runs in the visible PTY the operator is watching — the
 *   same principle as interactive SSH auth.
 * - NOTHING executes without authorization: the exact command and install
 *   destination print first, and execution needs a TTY confirmation or an
 *   explicit `--yes` (the macOS flow confirms against this module's own
 *   `--dry-run --json` disclosure before passing `--yes`). For a host
 *   integration, `--target local --yes` IS that authorization, granted by the
 *   owner action that invoked it; there is no second confirmation hidden
 *   inside the producer, and the unattended script path never claims the
 *   human-observed verification the watched remote path earns.
 * - concurrent installs into one prefix are serialized by a cross-process
 *   lease. A lease whose owner died is NOT reclaimed automatically: it fails
 *   closed with a typed `install_lock_stale` and the exact cleanup path.
 * - failures are typed and loud; a failed download, a non-zero installer exit,
 *   or a failed post-install binary/version proof never reads as success, and
 *   the temp download dir is removed on every path.
 * - the post-install PROOF is what the local target has instead of a witness.
 *   A watched remote install keeps the historical exit-code contract, because
 *   the operator is looking at the terminal; an unattended local install must
 *   earn its `ok:true`, so exit zero without a resolvable launcher and a
 *   matching `--version` is a typed failure, and `installedBinary` /
 *   `installedVersion` are present on every local success.
 * - `--json` keeps stdout pure: exactly ONE JSON object. In json mode every
 *   human progress line goes to stderr and child processes (npm/curl/the
 *   vendor script) run with their stdout routed onto stderr, so vendor
 *   output stays visible without corrupting the machine envelope.
