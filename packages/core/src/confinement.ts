/**
 * OS-enforced filesystem confinement for a delegated harness process.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT AN ENV VAR. A scoped `HOME` redirects `~`-relative lookups
 * and nothing else; `/Users/<op>/.claudexor/v3/daemon/token` — a bearer for the
 * whole control API — stays one absolute path away. The threat model, the
 * live reproduction and the list of what this does NOT cover are in
 * docs/DELEGATED_CONFINEMENT.md; keep them in step with this file.
 *
 * WHY THE HARNESS SANDBOX STANDS DOWN. macOS refuses `sandbox_apply` inside an
 * already-restricted process (measured: any deny clause in the outer profile is
 * enough), and codex shells out to `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` for its own
 * workspace-write sandbox. An outer boundary and the harness's own are
 * mutually exclusive, so the engine states `external_sandbox_full` — the
 * access profile that already means "I am providing the sandbox" — and each
 * adapter maps that onto its own switch. No harness name is branched on. That
 * stand-down is spent ONLY where a boundary was actually proven available: a
 * host with none keeps whatever enforcement the harness brings itself.
 *
 * WHERE THERE IS NO BOUNDARY — every platform but macOS, by owner decision, and
 * a macOS host missing `sandbox-exec`. The run still runs, on the scoped `HOME`
 * alone. It does not pretend: the absence and its reason are recorded on the
 * attempt, told to the child, and returned to the caller. Refusing instead would
 * make "delegated" a macOS-only feature; claiming a boundary we did not prove
 * would be worse than having none, so the type below cannot express a mechanism
 * name without the path it was proven to deny.
