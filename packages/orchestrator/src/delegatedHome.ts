 * environment so a harness whose native session store hangs off `$HOME` can
 * resume its vendor conversation.
 *
 * A DELEGATED run (`execution.delegated`) is scoped either way. The scoped HOME
 * redirects native state and profile selection; it is deliberately not called
 * a filesystem boundary. Mutating delegated attempts disclose that Claudexor
 * adds no outer OS boundary and leave the selected harness's native access mode
 * in effect.
 *
 * THE COST of the scoped home, stated plainly: an in-place delegated attempt
 * CANNOT resume a native vendor session whose store lives under the real `$HOME`
 * — cursor (`~/.cursor`) and opencode (XDG data under `$HOME`) lose resume.
 * codex and claude keep it: their native session stores are Claudexor-owned
 * directories that the adapter re-points on top of this env, and the macOS login Keychain is reached through
 * the declared scoped-home bridge (INV-067), so subscription auth is unaffected.
 *
 * Never degrades silently: a delegated attempt whose scoped home is not on disk refuses.
