# Claudexor Checklists

These are human gates for contributors changing Claudexor. They are intentionally
plain checklists, not a metadata system or hardcoded docs allowlist.

## Docs Hygiene

Use this before committing documentation changes.

- Public docs describe current behavior, current integration surfaces, or current
  contributor workflow.
- Public docs do not contain raw planning prompts, local operator notes, review
  transcripts, local paths, token handling notes, or one-off release scratch.
- `README.md` links only to maintained current docs.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the current runtime map and does not depend on
  deleted or historical plans/specs.
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` states current support, stability tiers, and disclosed limitations instead of
  promising every future integration surface.
- `docs/WHITEPAPER.md` is current when runtime, harness, auth/setup,
  observability, budget, orchestration, or permission behavior changes.
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and this file cover contributor process; product docs do
  not explain private review rituals.
- Local operator notes and temporary review packet directories remain local-only
  and gitignored.
- `docs/FEATURES.md` rows for any feature the change touches are updated or
  deleted in the same commit (a feature that became solid loses its row).
- Before release, search public docs for stale deleted-doc links, private review
  packet names, local absolute paths, raw planning prompts, transcript-style
  review verdicts, and token-like values.

## Design Discipline (locked operator directives)

These are LOCKED rules for all future work. Do not re-litigate them.

- **Meta-solutions over patches.** Always prefer a general, adaptive, generalizable
  design over a one-off patch. Data-drive from declared capabilities, use single
  producers with translational consumers, and favor typed contracts over
  hardcoded enums-in-logic, so new values / harnesses / modes work without
  re-patching. Reference example: the effort-ladder normalizer — adapters declare
  their `effort_levels`, a shared normalizer clamps to them, and no per-level value
  is hardcoded in logic. Generalization is earned, not automatic: before adding
  a restriction, name the demonstrated marginal danger, affected common path,
  and why existing trust, review, custody, and rollback controls are insufficient.
  If a restriction touches a supported path, its acceptance proof includes a
  positive production-shaped E2E of the promised capability, not only a denial
  or policy-shape assertion; capability loss blocks the restriction.
- **Staged-field rule.** A schema field ships only WITH a real producer AND a real
  consumer in the SAME change; otherwise it is deleted, never left as a dead or
  fake knob. This is exactly what `pnpm knip` plus the docs-truth gate enforce.

## Schema Changes

- Change `packages/schema` first.
- Regenerate JSON Schema with `pnpm schema:gen`.
- Update TypeScript consumers.
- Update Swift DTOs if control API payloads changed.
- Update public docs that describe the changed contract.
- Staged-field rule: a schema field ships in the same change as at least one
  real producer and one real consumer. Do not land speculative fields that
  nothing writes or reads — delete them or finish the wiring.
- Run:

```bash
pnpm schema:gen
git diff --exit-code packages/schema/generated
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

## Runtime Behavior Changes

- Confirm the change belongs in core/orchestrator/gateway/delivery/review/etc.,
  not in a thin surface.
- Keep CLI, daemon/control API, MCP/ACP, and macOS behavior aligned.
- Add focused tests at the package boundary that owns the behavior.
- Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` when the run flow, artifact layout, storage,
  auth, routing, settings, or control API changes.
- Update `docs/WHITEPAPER.md` when behavior changes affect the public rationale,
  trust model, orchestration semantics, observability, setup/auth, budget, or
  harness policy model.
- Harness setup/login actions, including the Terminal launch, must be owned by
  the daemon/Control API. UI code may display or copy the returned allowlisted
  command and guide, but must not construct or execute harness login/install
  commands locally.
- Effective setup-login capability is projected from the adapter's managed-login
  declaration, exact vendor binary, and the same bounded terminal resolver the
  runner calls immediately before spawn. Assert own-property `setupLogin` on
  every current harness/catalog row, legacy omission compatibility, and
  `external_terminal` rather than false `in_app` when the daemon backend is not
  ready. Request/profile/cardinality validation must precede helper probing and
  durable creation; rejected requests make zero helper/vendor calls and zero
  mutations.
- Native login must use the shared absolute binary + argv spec and a
  provider-secret-scrubbed environment; no `sh -c`, OAuth callback broker, or
  copied Terminal output. The manifest owns exactly one `managed_login.stdin`
  declaration per setup command; command flow/window/argv stay in the command
  registry and input class is not re-authored there.
- Cancel/timeout/restart must stop only an identity-proven process group (TERM,
  bounded KILL fallback) and reach terminal state only after death proof. Test
  PID reuse, missing/corrupt sidecars, and `termination_unconfirmed`.
- DEFAULT-store native-login success requires a journaled runner receipt plus a
  fresh exact-route same-harness capability smoke. Prove wrong
  route/source/challenge, tools, external context, mutation, timeout, crash,
  and restart all fail closed; an in-flight smoke after restart is
  `interrupted_unknown` and is not replayed. A PROFILE login (INV-135)
  verifies on the profile's own doctor probe and skips the smoke — prove an
  unverified probe fails closed and the default store stays untouched.
- Setup lifecycle authority is the checksummed global journal. Prove v1 bytes
  remain byte/mode-identical, per-job lifecycle snapshots are absent, corrupt
  state blocks mutation, and operational sidecars cannot override the journal.
- Verify duplicate create returns the same active action, conflicting mutating
  actions refuse, cancellation is asynchronous until death proof, and the
  vendor Terminal remains open on its result until Return.
- Setup SSE must preserve request-relative predecessor cursors across sparse
  global sequences. Missing/duplicate/regressive/malformed/dropped frames and
  EOF without terminal evidence require resnapshot; `interrupted_unknown` is
  terminal.
- Run success/no-op semantics must be evidence-based: auth/API/harness failures
  are failed diagnostics, not empty-diff `no_op`.
- Tool success, web evidence, and tmp/workspace claims must be evidence-based:
  preserve redacted tool error detail; `tool_result.is_error === true` blocks
  claimed success unless verified recovery exists; absolute `/tmp/...` is not
  project diff evidence.
- No regex governance for risk, permissions, tool success, web-required
  detection, winners, or tests-passed.
- If a native surface is discovered but not wired to active runs, expose it as a
  capability note only; do not enable live input/steering controls.
- Treat manifest auth sources as source availability only. Readiness, run
  routing, Auth UI status, and reviewer eligibility must come from doctor status,
  enabled intents, and smoke/conformance checks.
- Fixture rule: when an adapter's native stream parsing changes, refresh or add
  a recorded fixture under `packages/harness-<id>/fixtures/` and keep the
  conformance parity test green (typed tool_call/tool_result with status,
  usage, schema-valid events). Fixtures come from real CLI streams when
  available; synthetic fixtures must match the documented native shape and be
  replaced by recorded ones at the next paid smoke.

## macOS Visual QA

- Verify dark and light appearances.
- Verify Reduce Motion and Reduce Transparency.
- Toolbar stability (GH #21): switch the Appearance theme repeatedly and confirm
  the trailing toolbar pill cluster does NOT shift — a state-varying glyph must
  reserve a constant width.
- Keyboard navigation (QA-076 / issue-076), the manual keyboard story — no
  headless test exists yet:
  - Enable macOS Keyboard navigation (System Settings → Keyboard, or `Ctrl-F7`).
  - In the main window, Tab/Shift-Tab through the composer and, with the workspace
    open, the Changes/Artifacts/Evidence tabs and the remote-only Terminal tab:
    every visible enabled control is reachable exactly once, focus never
    dead-ends on one tab or falls back to the window, and Shift-Tab is the exact
    inverse. Activate each with Space/Return.
  - In Settings, Tab must ENTER the window (never leave focus on the window) and
    reach each pane's enabled buttons/fields; switch panes and repeat.
  - Negative control (reduced Tab mode OFF): plain Tab visiting only text/list
    controls is correct platform behavior, not a failure; `Ctrl-F5` toolbar entry
    and arrow-key movement inside a focused group are correct too.
- VoiceOver / AX names (QA-003 / issue-003): every icon-only control announces a
  stable English NAME (More options, Attach files, Capture screen region, Remove
  attachment, Appearance, workspace tabs, Copy message), the Appearance control
  keeps ONE name while its value changes System/Light/Dark, and decorative
  section-header glyphs create no phantom stops. Spot-check on a non-`en` host
  (`ru_RU`): the names stay English (no `Изменить`/`Экспозиция`).
- Check compact, medium, and wide window sizes.
- Check composer, mode menu, harness chips, Settings, run detail, diagnostics,
  and onboarding.
- Look specifically for hard side/top material artifacts, titlebar overlap,
  unreadable glass behind dense content, and hover help gaps.
- Check every sheet or blocking subflow has a visible close/Done or Back/Continue
  path.
- INV-136 stress story: open a multi-harness run with large rollouts/events,
  switch threads and enter Diagnostics. Assert hydration fetches no raw
  event/rollout/log bodies, chat discloses its bounded tail, Diagnostics stays
  metadata-first, and the app remains responsive. Full evidence must still
  open from the run folder.
- Exercise a plan with many open questions at compact height: the plan question
  card scrolls its questions/options lazily inside a bounded middle while the
  header and Implement/answer controls stay visible and clickable. Restart the
  app, reopen the owning thread, and verify open questions restore from the plan
  artifact while an accepted answer restores as a read-only receipt from its
  typed answer-turn relation (never a blank or re-submittable card).
- Plan loop: readiness is derived server-side from `final/questions.json`
  (`ready`/`needs_answers`/`unverified`); the card renders that projection and
  never re-parses plan text. Implement freezes the plan (sha256 on the turn);
  a tampered or unreadable plan must fail loudly, and implementing with open
  questions must be an explicit, recorded choice — never a silent default.
- Disclosure rows (`DisclosureRow`, DESIGN_SYSTEM §5.1): on every "Advanced …"
  row, the Workspace Evidence run rows, and the Diff file headers, click the
  LABEL and the trailing whitespace — the whole header must toggle, never just
  the chevron. Hover shows a highlight; Reduce Motion snaps the chevron; with
  keyboard navigation Space/Return toggle and Right/Left arrows expand/collapse;
  VoiceOver announces one button with a Collapsed/Expanded value.
- Connections (Settings → Connections): the New SSH Host sheet — Return submits
  only when valid, Escape cancels, field errors appear under their own field
  after touch and clear on edit, the preview block matches the appended bytes,
  and the post-create receipt names the config path and either the real backup
  path or "Created a new config; there was no previous file to back up" (a
  fresh config must NEVER claim a backup). Exercise all four picker states —
  config missing, no concrete aliases, every alias already added, scan failed
  (e.g. an unreadable Include) — and confirm the picker placeholder + hover
  help name the REAL state, with the scan failure also visible inline. Verify
  the row status ladder: Offline muted, Connecting/Installing accent,
  Needs authentication warning, Connected success, Failed danger — dot + label.
- Check the inline per-turn review/diff surfaces and other dense content (in the
  run inspector and on turn cards) do not force the whole app window to a wide
  fixed minimum.
- Check budget cap editing uses validated currency input fields, not sliders.
- Check completed runs show Outcome/answer first, running runs show Timeline,
  and failures without output show Diagnostics.
- Keep dense content on solid surfaces; use Liquid Glass on navigation/chrome and
  floating controls.
- Check markdown Outcome/report/plan rendering in light/dark, including code
  blocks on `surface/code`.
- Check web/tool evidence badges, output-ready state, fallback events, setup job
  states, and budget source match CLI/Control API projections.
- In AuthSheet, exercise background close/reopen, Cancel Login/Stay, countdown
  and unlimited fixed extensions, Retry, Reconnect exhaustion, Open Log, and
  native readiness distinct from overall/API-key readiness.
- Block on clipped text, hidden terminal state, glass behind dense output,
  hardcoded colors, weak dark-card contrast, fixed-width overflow, or technical
  artifacts shown as user plans/outcomes.

## Security And Secrets

- Raw secrets must not appear in jobs, task contracts, events, summaries,
  artifacts, patches, PR text, docs, or logs.
- Native/subscription routes should not inherit provider API-key env vars unless
  an API-key source is explicit.
- A native login may pass only after fresh `native_session = available + passed`;
  prove that a present/passing API key cannot satisfy subscription verification.
- Verify the three readiness edges: absent/logged-out =
  `unavailable + not_run`, indeterminate probe = `unknown + not_run`, and
  present-but-wrong/unusable = `available + failed`.
- Native login must use vendor-owned config/Keychain state without reading,
  copying, or persisting vendor session tokens/credential files. Keep stored API
  keys and the Claude setup-token as distinct routes; prove they cannot satisfy
  a targeted `native_session` probe.
- Scoped harness homes/config dirs stay outside mutation worktrees. When a
  native route requires host-user or OS-keychain access, verify only the
  declared bridge/context is exposed and temporary harness state cannot leak
  into the real home.
- Env-portability sweep (INV-067): any auth/readiness/routing change is
  verified against EVERY lane class — read-only scoped-HOME, isolated
  envelope, and in-place — never just the host env. A route whose primary
  credential store is outside a generic scoped HOME must use only its declared
  MINIMAL vendor-specific bridge (Claude: disposable Claude-only child HOME
  with only `Library/Keychains` bridged; exact `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` selects the
  account and is Claudexor-owned — ordinary `~/.claude` stays untouched) or
  its designed portable transport (Codex file-only seed). Prove
  generic scoped homes and other harnesses do NOT receive the bridge, writable
  vendor state remains scoped, default and profile logins both work, and a
  missing bridge refuses with the real cause + Native setup remedy. A green
  host doctor with a red scoped-env probe is a finding, not a flake.
- **CONCEPT-CHANGE(INV-067, INV-135):** test the effective platform policy,
  not a universal "profile HOME equals credential identity" assumption.
  Windows Antigravity permits one enabled OS-user-scoped binding: create and
  enable enforce the bound atomically, disable remains the recovery action,
  over-cap legacy state fails routing/setup/quota with
  `credential_profile_ambiguous` and zero probes, and disabled rows sharing
  that OS-user credential are never probed. Disabled rows backed by
  profile-isolated credentials remain non-routable but retain readiness probes.
  Deletion removes Claudexor-owned state while the receipt explicitly
  reports the vendor OS-user credential left unchanged.
- Versioned repo config must never self-grant sensitive powers.
- Run a targeted search for token-like values when touching auth, secrets,
  artifact writing, or logging.

## Release

- `git status --short` reviewed.
- Public docs and app README are aligned with current behavior.
- `pnpm release:verify` passes.
- Node 20.19.0 and the current pinned Node CI lanes pass; both clean npm install
  smokes must complete before the GitHub Release is published.
- `pnpm release:workflow:check` passes: every action is full-SHA pinned,
  workflow inputs are projected through environment variables rather than
  interpolated into shell, and unsigned/clobber fallbacks are absent.
- Schema generated diff is clean.
- `node scripts/docs-truth-check.mjs` passes (endpoints, mode ids, CLI flags
  match docs).
- `pnpm knip` passes (no unused exports/files; dead code is deleted, not
  allowlisted, unless a justified baseline entry explains why).
- When runtime/harness resilience changes, the fixed real-harness battery
  (`pnpm battery:real`) is rerun or explicitly waived with the ENV/network
  evidence that made it inconclusive. Release acceptance uses the credentialed
  disposable-VM existing-default lane from `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, without a
  phase filter: its forced uncached build and receipt must bind the launched
  daemon entry digest to the exact candidate handshake, prove the config
  contract of the unified account model — a PRE-migration (v3.5) fixture may
  undergo exactly ONE receipt-backed startup migration (the auto-registered
  `<harness>-default` rows plus the migration phase file, nothing else), and
  the row/locator/backup receipt and ordered backup chain must match (the first
  backup byte-identical to the pre-start config, later backups containing only
  preceding appended rows at the same private mode); the SECOND
  and every later start must leave both `config.yaml` and
  `migration/accounts-unified.json` byte- and mode-identical; an
  already-migrated fixture must leave both identical from the first start —
  prove the native-access matrix with stable project identity separate from
  each delegated execution workspace, real edit plus test completion, exact
  requested/effective access, requested/observed model, named-profile native
  state, deliberate no-outer-boundary evidence, and no `sandbox-exec`; require
  OpenCode `workspace_write` to refuse before spawn and record unavailable
  OpenCode Full as a typed conditional omission rather than PASS/SKIP —
  prove every durable route interval in every Codex and
  Claude task attempt stayed on a disclosed native session, and report
  `FAIL=0 ENV=0 SKIP=0`. A scratch or partial run is diagnostic evidence, not
  this acceptance gate.
- New terminal states, retry events, or telemetry fields are documented in
  architecture/development docs and have generated schema updates.
- Swift tests/build pass.
- Live native-login acceptance passes for Codex, Claude, Cursor, and
  Antigravity on each claimed platform: observe
  awaiting_user -> verifying -> succeeded, typed auth status, background
  recovery, and duplicate-create suppression without logout or credential reads.
  For Darwin Antigravity, the disposable profile-keychain proof also records
  unchanged host default/list preferences and host security-plist state, while
  two profile HOMEs resolve separate vendor items; no file fallback bytes are
  copied or migrated.
  Windows terminal-input acceptance starts from a console-attached control
  process, proves the production print probe cannot open `CONIN$`, proves the
  bounded ConPTY helper protocol before vendor start, and verifies timeout/
  cancel cleanup with exact PIDs and honest unconfirmed outcomes.
- Packaged app/ZIP/DMG and the npm CLI package contain the setup-login runner;
  the bundle boot smoke starts both the daemon and helper with bundled Node.
- The signed candidate executes the exact packaged daemon `--probe` with its
  bundled Node before notarization and again after ZIP extraction; direct-entry
  proof must survive canonical macOS `/tmp`/`/var` path aliases and still reject
  a different existing file with the same basename.
- When Delegate surfaces change, exact-candidate UI acceptance proves the
  healthy `requested/effective/used/reason` receipt, child/parent lineage, and a
  `waitingOnUser` child answered from its inline card. Detail failure must show
  its cause plus Retry instead of an endless spinner. Run this in the isolated
  macOS VM with real HID clicks and screenshot evidence, not UI automation alone.
- Review gate: the Release review protocol (see the section below) — optional
  pre-freeze internal critics, then one parallel full-context wave with
  the exact reviewer pair the Release review protocol section defines
  (2026-08-06: Cursor operator subagents), one
  adjudication, one batched correction commit, and one confirmation wave
  focused on that delta while both lanes retain the full candidate context.
- Local unsigned app packages are smoke artifacts only. Final DMG/ZIP assets
  come from GitHub Actions `candidate` then `publish` mode; missing signing or
  notarization credentials block publication. Publish promotes the exact
  twelve-asset candidate set byte-for-byte (DMG, ZIP, app SBOM, SHA256SUMS,
  engine closure + unsigned runtime manifest, the four remote SSH runtime
  archives, the unsigned remote manifest, and the remote SBOM), verifying every
  promoted asset in ONE early provenance loop before any use; only the two
  operator-signed manifests (`runtime_manifest_b64` and
  `remote_runtime_manifest_b64`, sealed offline via `pnpm sign:runtime-manifest`
  / `pnpm sign:remote-runtime-manifest`). The required `candidate_run_id`
  selects the candidate workflow run whose exact artifacts are promoted; only
  those manifests, the review attestation, and the final checksum set are
  assembled in the publish run. The remote SBOM is regenerated
  from the promoted unsigned manifest and must `cmp` byte-identical to the
  candidate SBOM before the candidate bytes ship.
- One-release exception for 3.8.0 only: the owner-authorized publish may set
  `skip_custom_ed25519: true` with all three custom-Ed25519 inputs empty. Verify
  that the final asset set omits `REVIEW_ATTESTATION.json`,
  `runtime-manifest.json`, and `remote-runtime-manifest.json` and never promotes
  the unsigned candidate manifests under those names. Record that the existing
  app engine update and first-time remote bootstrap are unavailable for 3.8.0;
  DMG/ZIP signing and notarization, npm publication, SBOMs, GitHub artifact
  provenance, and npm provenance remain required. Every other version and the
  default `false` path retain the normal schema-v6 and signed-manifest gates.
- One-release review-only exception for 3.8.1: the owner-authorized publish may
  set `waive_cursor_review: true` when the required Cursor Fable/Sol lanes are
  unavailable. The review input must be empty, both owner-signed runtime
  manifests must be supplied and verified, and the final assets must omit only
  `REVIEW_ATTESTATION.json`. This does not create or claim a formal Cursor
  review; exact candidate provenance, signed/notarized app bytes, both runtime
  signatures, SBOMs, npm/GitHub provenance, and every other release gate still
  apply. The verifier rejects this waiver for all versions except 3.8.1 and
  rejects combining it with `skip_custom_ed25519`.
- The shared engine closure remains one artifact and one signed authority for
  app updates and host embedding. Its archive entries are only regular files
  or directories; internal dependency links are materialized with their
  expected bytes, escaping links/special files/`.node` addons are refused, Node
  is absent, the reviewed daemon and CLI bundles are present and stamped with
  the same build SHA, and the daemon's `--probe` identity still matches the
  publication manifest or its derived reviewed host pin. Portable extraction
  is not evidence of feature parity for every harness/login path on that OS.
  Embedded start/handshake/stop use one exact config root/socket and one tested
  full Node toolchain; POSIX local harness installation additionally proves the
  exact adjacent npm entrypoint without PATH fallback. A Windows support claim has a native
  extract/probe/handshake/graceful-stop smoke receipt.
- Except for the explicit 3.8.0 and 3.8.1 waivers above, the publish input is an annotated
  stable tag on exact `origin/main` plus a signed schema-v6 attestation. It binds
  the candidate SHA/tree/version, exact
  full-gate receipt, sealed evidence manifest/diff/wave, and the two required
  operator reviewer reports (digests + model slugs) with non-blocking verdicts
  (see the Release review protocol). Verify the Ed25519 signature against the
  tracked pinned public key before semantic validation. Reject non-v6,
  unsigned, unknown-key, tampered, substituted, or incomplete publish inputs;
  schema v2-v5 stays signature-verifiable only as archived evidence.
- Verify app, ZIP-contained app, and DMG signatures, notarization tickets,
  staples, checksums, SBOM, and GitHub provenance. Do not upload stale local
  `apps/macos/dist` artifacts.
- DMG quarantine smoke before publish: download the candidate DMG/ZIP asset,
  verify its sha256 against SHA256SUMS, confirm the downloaded file carries
  `com.apple.quarantine`, run `codesign --verify --deep --strict` and
  `spctl --assess` on the app, and boot the quarantined (translocated) app.
- npm packages publish with provenance in dependency order. Existing versions
  are retryable only when local tarball integrity and published provenance
  match; any mismatch blocks as a version collision.
- Two dist-tags move, and only one of them moves by itself. `npm publish` runs
  with no `--tag`, so npm moves `latest` — which the provenance check then
  REQUIRES to have moved, so do not add `--tag` to that publish. `next` is moved
  separately, by `moveNextChannel` after the signature audit, because preview
  consumers resolve that channel deliberately and must not stay on stale bytes
  after a stable promotion. Ouroboros runtime delivery is exact-archive pinned;
  it does not resolve either npm tag. After a release, confirm both:
  `npm view claudexor dist-tags`.
- Release assets are uploaded without `--clobber`; a same-name differing asset
  blocks. Publish the draft last and never edit its tag/assets afterward. This
  is workflow-enforced immutability, not a claim about GitHub repository settings.
- GitHub release notes summarize shipped behavior; they do not publish private
  planning notes or review scratch.
- Pre-release immune scan (MANDATORY, no cron): an autonomous read-only audit
  of the WHOLE tree against `CLAUDEXOR_BIBLE.md` — not just the release diff.
  The auditor reads the Bible end-to-end, then verifies each invariant's
  `verify:` note against current code/docs/gates, hunting the boiled-frog
  drift per-commit diffs cannot show. Output is a findings list (file/line
  evidence, invariant id, severity) — tickets or fixes BEFORE the tag, never
  silent edits during the scan. Blocking bar: any invariant whose verify note
  is no longer true, any gate that no longer runs where its invariant says it
  does, any doc claim contradicting shipped behavior.
- Fixture freshness at release grade: `node scripts/fixture-freshness-check.mjs
  --strict` — recorded adapter fixtures must match the installed vendor CLI
  versions (drift fails strict; re-record when stale). Synthetic-only
  harnesses are disclosure NOTES, never strict failures — recording is gated
  on live route availability, not the release calendar. The strict leg runs
  HERE (operator machine, via `pnpm release:verify`); the tag workflow runs
  the STRUCTURE check only because the GitHub runner has no vendor CLIs and
  a missing CLI with recorded fixtures is strict-fatal by design.
- Cursor E2E when MCP/plugin surfaces changed: `node scripts/cursor-itest.mjs`
  (scripted phases A/C/D + failure modes) passes, then the two MANUAL phases:
  - Phase B (Cursor discovery): `claudexor plugin repair cursor`, reload
    Cursor, then verify the project-scoped descriptor store
    (`~/.cursor/projects/<proj>/mcps/plugin-claudexor-claudexor/tools/*.json`)
    exposes the CURRENT tool schemas (spot-check `claudexor_run` has
    `model`/`effort`/`web`/`reviewerPanel`) — Cursor refreshes tool schemas
    only on reconnect (no listChanged support), so a stale cache after an
    upgrade is the expected failure mode this step catches.
  - Phase E (agent-in-the-loop): in Cursor, in a fixture workspace, prompt
    "Use the claudexor skill to check harness status, then get a read-only
    plan for fixing add()" — the agent must call `claudexor_status` then
    `claudexor_plan` with an explicit `repoPath`, and the run dir must appear
    in the fixture repo (not Cursor's cwd).
  - When no human operator is available for the MANUAL phases, they are
    recorded as an explicitly-waived `docs/FEATURES.md` row naming the
    untested surface, and the release report calls the waiver out — never
    silently skipped, never replaced with "equivalent" scripted checks.

## Review Protocol

- Review the exact current tree/diff. Any mutation after review makes the review
  stale for touched files.
- Findings need evidence: file/line, diff, command output, artifact, or observed
  UI behavior. No evidence means no blocking finding.
- Check Bible/architecture/design/development alignment at the same strictness as
  correctness and security.
- Classify each finding as accepted, rejected, duplicate, deferred, or out of
  scope. Fix only accepted findings verified against current code/docs.
- Treat every reviewer finding and proposed patch as a hypothesis. Before
  accepting it, reproduce the behavior, identify the root cause and canonical
  owner/SSOT, search sibling surfaces and other instances of the same failure
  class, and check the governing invariant or operator-approved criterion. Repair the class
  only when multiple surfaces or a broken SSOT boundary prove it; otherwise
  prefer the smallest local correction. Investigate over believe; generalize
  over overfit; meta over patch.
- Reject scope drift and overengineering that does not serve the accepted user
  intent.
- Before release, run the local multi-review protocol and Claudexor dogfood
  review when available; if reviewer output is empty, erroneous, or reads the
  wrong tree, treat the review gate as failed rather than ceremonial.
- If a change intentionally edits existing protected gate/test files, record the
  approval through the typed run surface (`--allow-protected-path` or
  `protectedPathApprovals`) instead of relying on prompt prose or repo config.
- When the required review gate names exact reviewers or repeated models from
  the same harness, use the explicit `reviewerPanel` / `--reviewer-panel` path
  and verify the per-reviewer telemetry records every requested entry separately.
- Reviewer panels and protected-path approvals are Agent-only. Ask and Plan
  must reject them at the schema boundary; use Council when a Plan needs
  multi-harness critique, never the retired standalone Plan-review path.
- Review-panel spend is route-scoped: native subscription reviewers settle to
  valuation, API-key reviewers to cash. Verify mixed panels preserve both
  totals and never debit the aggregate as cash.
- Reviewers must inspect the complete Git-visible candidate and read file-backed
  evidence (`DIFF.patch`, user dialogue, decided tradeoffs, tests, gate receipt)
  from the sealed evidence directory. Do not divide the repository into tiny
  batches that hide architecture, and do not pass the full diff through argv.
  The native harness reads files directly and may use the internet where source
  verification is useful.
- Reviewer workspaces must project one frozen source inventory: Git-visible
  files plus exact diff-touched paths, or diff-touched postimages only when no
  Git inventory exists. Prove that unrelated ignored local instructions and an
  ignored sibling beside a diff-touched file are absent, while explicit evidence
  remains available through its separate packet boundary.
- Synthesis follows the same argv-size law: candidate diffs/findings are a
  temporary file inside the synthesis envelope, never concatenated into the
  process prompt. Verify the file is recreated on retry and removed before
  diff/gate/review; a race with large/binary diffs must not fail `spawn E2BIG`.
- When a candidate answer links generated screenshots, verify bounded raster
  copies survive envelope disposal in the run-artifact plane and the winner's
  relative markdown links resolve; do not claim dead worktree paths.
- Cursor parser fixtures must cover `{failure:{exitCode}}` tool results as
  errors and use the last complete assistant message as typed final (not the
  concatenated terminal `result`).
- Candidate cards: errored/unverified attempts can never project
  `finalReviewClean=true`; expose the first redacted error reason. Zero
  configured gates render `n/a`, not “passed”.
- Auto-rotation with no surviving profile emits
  `route.profile.rotation_exhausted` with per-profile rejection/headroom facts.
- Account/profile coherence: ready is exact-source `available + passed`; Use
  atomically selects the profile harness/pool; incompatible explicit pools
  start zero adapters; delete clears all thread pins, matching native-session
  caches, draft selection, and quota snapshots.
  `available + failed` must start zero attempts. A named-profile Manage sheet
  must never expose or mutate the default/global API-key fallback slot.
  Deletion must refuse before registry removal if any project partition cannot
  durably invalidate dependencies.
- Retry accounting: fixtures must switch native→API-key within one candidate
  and one reviewer; each usage event settles by its own/current typed route,
  never the attempt's first route.
- Synthesis staging must restore a pre-existing sentinel byte/mode-identically
  and refuse live or dangling symlinks using no-follow creation; success/retry/
  failure must leave no staging diff or host-side target.
- Diff demand loading: controls derive patch availability from metadata, a tab
  opened before metadata retriggers, and 413/network/non-text failures show
  reason + path + Retry rather than spinning forever.
- Bounded primary output: test exactly 256 KiB, +1 byte, the redaction overlap
  boundary, and split UTF-8; every omitted byte sets `truncated=true`.
- Persist local/redacted per-reviewer telemetry: requested model/effort, observed
  model/source, route proof, start/first-event/completion-or-timeout timestamps,
  duration, raw normalized stream or transcript, parsed JSON blocks, and parse
  errors.
- Bind every required reviewer to the same external sealed evidence directory
  (`FREEZE.json`, complete `MANIFEST.sha256`, exact `DIFF.patch`, and
  `USER_DIALOGUE.md`) and exact clean candidate SHA/tree. Start both native
  reviewers at one concurrency boundary in fresh read-only workspaces; a
  missing packet, worktree, manifest match, or exact route fails before either
  slot can count. Each wave uses a new external output directory; existing
  reviewer artifacts are never overwritten.
- Emit reviewer progress events (`reviewer.started`, `reviewer.first_event`,
  `reviewer.completed`, `reviewer.timed_out`, `reviewer.failed`) so a concurrent
  panel is diagnosable and does not look like a hang.

### Release review protocol (v6, operator-locked — INV-125/INV-139)

This is the ONLY release review protocol. History for context: the 2.1.0
release ran 18 wave rounds without converging (~40% of findings re-surfaced
earlier "accepted" fixes; ~26% of the release diff was authored by the loop
itself). This protocol bounds the loop mechanically while preserving the full
repository context that small review packets lost.

- **One wave, in parallel, on a frozen candidate SHA**: exactly two formal
  full-context reviewers, executed as Cursor operator subagents per the
  operator-approved panel (`OWNER_REVIEW_PANEL` in
  `scripts/lib/release-review-contract.mjs`): slot `fable` = one slug from
  {`claude-fable-5-thinking-max`, `claude-fable-5-thinking-medium`,
  `claude-fable-5-thinking-high`}, slot
  `sol` = one slug from {`gpt-5.6-sol-xhigh`, `gpt-5.6-sol-max`,
  `gpt-5.6-sol-high`, `gpt-5.6-sol-medium`}. Each
  reviewer receives the complete Git-visible candidate repository, complete
  diff, the same sealed evidence, operator dialogue/decisions, and tests, and may
  use live internet access where source verification is useful. No substitute
  model, API-key fallback, packet split, or extra critic can fill either
  slot; a slug outside a slot's tier set refuses fail-closed.
- **One sealed packet** for every reviewer: `MANIFEST.sha256`,
  `FREEZE.json`, `DIFF.patch` + digest, `TESTS.txt`, the decision registry
  (change → D#/invariant mapping), `FORBIDDEN_FINDINGS.md`,
  `DECLINED_FINDINGS.md` (previously rejected findings with reasons), and
  `BLOCKER_FILTER.md` (the blocker contract below) — present from wave 1.
- **Blocker contract (INV-139)**: a blocking finding must cite a violated
  invariant or operator-approved criterion, carry reproducible evidence, and
  be reachable in the default configuration. Reachability caps severity at
  WARN otherwise. Reviewer `proposed_fix` is advisory. A finding that
  re-litigates a recorded operator decision is out-of-scope by construction —
  ledgered, never fixed.
- **One adjudication → one batched fix commit.** Only findings passing the
  blocker contract earn fixes; everything else becomes a `docs/FEATURES.md`
  row, a BACKLOG entry, or a DECLINED ledger row in the same commit. No
  "while I'm here" fixes inside the batch. EVERY finding gets exactly one
  row in `docs/reference/review-ledger.md` (the findings ledger); its
  declined rows are the next wave's `DECLINED_FINDINGS.md`.
- **One confirmation wave**, focused on the fix diff and every file it
  touched — both lanes still review in the same full context:
  `review_scope: "full"` is the only value the v6 contract accepts, and the
  retired sol delta scope can no longer satisfy any slot. A confirmation
  blocker on unchanged code without new evidence is invalid.
- **Stop.** New proven blockers after confirmation get a fix + targeted
  re-check of exactly those findings. Anything beyond that requires an
  explicit operator decision — the protocol never self-extends.
- **Ship rule**: confirmation pass + every open finding at WARN-or-below
  (each with its FEATURES/BACKLOG/DECLINED row) is releasable. A perfectly
  clean board is not required.
- **Reviewer liveness**: a slot counts only with a complete markdown report,
  a `pass|warn` verdict, and a recorded duration of at least one second, and
  the two executions must genuinely overlap in wall time; the two reports
  must be byte-distinct. Models, intervals, verdicts, and scope are
  operator-attested statements — this transport produces no independent
  session or event proof (an accepted property of the operator decision above).
  An empty or instant execution is an infrastructure failure. Frozen slots
  have no internal transient retry; an operator retry uses fresh artifacts
  and a fresh review wave on the same still-clean SHA. A failed required
  slot blocks sealing.
- **Review-contract self-test**: the schema-v6 contract and sealer
  validators are exercised in CI against hostile fixtures (missing, extra,
  or mismatched metadata fields, out-of-set model slugs, implausible or
  non-overlapping timing, duplicate reports, tampered signatures). Two
  identical failures from different models mean the PROTOCOL is wrong, not
  the models.
- **Evidence completeness is deterministic.** The sealed evidence packet owns
  the complete binary `DIFF.patch`, complete manifest, frozen SHA/tree and wave,
  full-gate receipt, and `USER_DIALOGUE.md`. Both reviewer subagents read that
  same evidence plus the complete candidate repository. Missing, changed,
  ignored-only, or secret-bearing evidence fails
  before a review can count; no omission note or partial pack substitutes for
  access to the whole tree.
- **Attestation:** `scripts/run-full-gate-receipt.mjs` runs exact
  `pnpm release:verify` on the clean candidate into a required external output
  directory, builds one small self-contained
  verifier from exact tracked HEAD sources, copies the packaged app's
  self-contained `claudexor.bundle.cjs`, and hashes both into the receipt. The
  operator transport never executes that copied CLI; it travels only as
  receipt-bound bytes. After both review subagents complete, the operator
  writes one external review-artifacts directory with exactly two reviewer
  directories (`01-fable/`, `02-sol/`), each holding `report.md` (the
  reviewer's complete markdown report) and an exact-shape `metadata.json`
  binding the slot, the actually used model slug, the candidate SHA and tree,
  the packet manifest digest, the review wave UUID, the `sha256:`-prefixed
  diff digest, exact ISO-8601 start/finish, a `pass|warn` verdict, the
  mandatory `review_scope: "full"`, and the report's SHA-256.
  `scripts/seal-owner-review-attestation.mjs --full-gate-receipt <file>
  --evidence-dir <dir> --review-artifacts <dir> --private-key <file>
  --authority release/review-attestation-authority.json --out <file>` imports
  the receipt-bound verifier bytes only after that exact gate passed,
  re-verifies the sealed packet and recomputes every evidence and artifact
  digest from regular non-symlink files, checks that `DIFF.patch` is the
  exact base..candidate diff and that the packet carries the byte-identical
  gate receipt, and refuses a missing, extra, malformed, or mismatched
  metadata field, a slug outside its slot's tier set, implausible or
  non-overlapping timing, duplicate report bytes, secret-like tokens, or any
  verdict outside `pass|warn`. It signs schema v6 (contract `owner-review-v6`,
  protocol `cursor-operator-fable-sol-v1`) offline with the same Ed25519
  review key, only for the final confirmation pair; the initial review and
  adjudication remain in the ledger and sealed evidence, not a second signed
  graph. `verify-release-input.mjs` verifies
  the signature before semantic validation. Schema v2-v5 remains
  signature-verifiable only for archived releases and cannot publish now.
